To build the latest version of Cogwheel, you can check out the source and build it yourself using free tools. The software has been developed with Visual Studio 2008 in mind.

## Requirements ##

  * An SVN client (such as [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/)).
  * A C#3 compiler ([Visual C# 2008 Express](http://www.microsoft.com/express/vcsharp/) is ideal).
  * [SlimDX developer SDK](http://slimdx.org/download.php).

## Details ##

  1. Install the SlimDX developer SDK.
  1. Check out the code to a local working copy using the URL `http://cogwheel.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/`.
  1. Open the solution file `Cogwheel.sln` in VC#.
  1. Set `Cogwheel SlimDX` as the startup project.

Hopefully by this point you should be able to build and run the project in either debug or release mode.
